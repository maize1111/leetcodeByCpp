# Develop Notes
Create a branch to update your answer

eg:

Create a branch for Question-100
    
    # create branch q100
    git branch q100
    # checkout branch q100
    git checkout q100

Then update, commit, and push your code at branch q100
    
    # add new files to git tree
    git add .
    # commit code update
    git commit -m "Commit Q-100"
    # push branch q100 to remote git lab
    git push -u origin q100

At last, create a pull request to merge to branch master
