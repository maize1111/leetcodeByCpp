# Develop Notes
Create a branch to update your answer

eg: Create a branch for Question-100
    
    git branch q100

Then update, commit, and push your code at branch q100
    
    git add .
    git commit -m "Commit Q-100"
    git push -u origin q100

At last, create a pull request to merge to branch master
